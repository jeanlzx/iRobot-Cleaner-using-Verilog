Coursework Assignment for Digital System & HDL

This project is a simple digital system for an intelligent Robot (iRobot) Cleaner for the floor using Verilog HDL on Quartus software, with the following specification:
- The iRobot Cleaner has four cleaning functionalities: vacuum, mop with soap, sanitize, and a combination of all three functions which runs on a fixed duration.
- It can be customized by the user to set the cleaning duration for each stage.
- It can set when to start the cleaning, i.e. 3 pm.
- It can detect a dirty spot on the floor and stay longer at that spot for cleaning.
- It will display a red light when the battery is low.

The design is implemented with a finite state machine (FSM) along with additional components such as arithmetic circuit, combinational circuit, register, counter, and decoders.
